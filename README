<h1>NHS Number Validation Examples</h1>
<p>
The NHS Number is 10 digits long. The last digit is the "Check Number" or "Check Digit ". This is used to validate the full NHS Number. A calculation is made on the first 9 digits and its sum is compared against the check digit to see if the NHS Number is correct.
</p>

<h2>The calculation </h2>

<p>
<strong>1)</strong> Multiply each of the first nine digits by a defined weight.  The weight is shown below:
</p>

<p>
1 - 10
</p>
<p>
2 - 9
</p>
<p>
3 - 8
</p>
<p>
4 - 7
</p>
<p>
5 - 6
</p>
<p>
6 - 5
</p>
<p>
7 - 4
</p>
<p>
8 - 3
</p>
<p>
9 - 2
</p>
<p>
For example if the 2nd digit is 3 then its 3 x 8.  If fourth digit is 7 then its 7 x 4
</p>
<p>
<strong>2)</strong> Get the sum of the 9 multiplications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3)</strong> Divide this sum by 11 and get the remainder
</p>
<p>
<strong>4)</strong> Subtract 11 from the remainder to get the total
</p>
<p>
<strong>5)</strong> If the total is 11 then the identifier is 0, otherwise the identifier is the total
</p>
<p>
<strong>6)</strong> If the identifier is 10 then the NHS Number is wrong
</p>
<p>
<strong>7)</strong> If the identifier equals the check number then the NHS number is correct
